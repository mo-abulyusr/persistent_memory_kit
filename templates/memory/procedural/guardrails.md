# Guardrails

Last updated: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ

1. Keep memory entries concise and factual.
2. Do not store secrets, credentials, or sensitive personal data.
3. Prefer appending history over rewriting old entries.
4. Add ADRs only for durable decisions (not transient choices).
5. Keep `current-state.md` short enough to scan in under one minute.
